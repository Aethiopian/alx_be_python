# Define the variables
P = 1000  # Principal amount (initial investment)
R = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
T = 3     # Time (in years)

# Calculate the simple interest
I = P * R * T

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest earned on an investment of {P} at an interest rate of {R*100}% over {T} years is {I}.")
