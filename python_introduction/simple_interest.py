# Define the variables
principal = 1000  # Principal amount (initial investment)
rate = 0.05  # Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
time = 3     # Time (in years)

# Calculate the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest earned on an investment of {P} at an interest rate of {R*100}% over {T} years is {I}.")
